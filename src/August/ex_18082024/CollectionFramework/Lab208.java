        // Can I increase the size of the array? No
        // Do we have any function to sort the array i.e. arr2.sort() - No
        // Do we have anything to find something the array - No
        // So, there are no in-built functions are available in the arrays
        // In-built functions like - sorting, updating, deleting, increasing size, decrease size
        // appending, finding ...
        // array can store one type of data type

        // ArrayList -> this has solved all the problem

        // Properties

        // In JDK 22 - there are advance collection classes that we can use.
